# Void -- zero-processing camera

![void](/images/projects/void/cover.jpg)

I wanted a simple camera to use without AI, overwhelming processing, or other “enhancing” features. As a result, I created Void Camera, mostly for myself. It’s simple, fast, and takes natural-looking photos.

It’s free, and you can download it on the App Store.
